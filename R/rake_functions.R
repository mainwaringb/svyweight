## ==== RAKESVY + RAKEW8 ====

#These is the workhorse functions for the package
#they are designed to allow flexible input formats for targets - However, flexibility also can be dangerous!

#TO DO
#Don't rename columns of data frames when converting to w8margin

#' Flexibly Calculate Rake Weights
#' @description Calculate rake weights on a data frame or
#'   \code{\link[survey]{svydesign}} object. Targets may be counts or
#'   percentages, in vector, matrix, data frame, or w8margin form. Before
#'   weighting, targets are converted to w8margins, checked for validity, and
#'   matched to variables in observed data, \code{rakesvy} returns a weighted
#'   \code{svydesign} object, while \code{rakew8} returns a vector of weights.
#' @param design An \code{\link[survey]{svydesign}} object, or a data frame that
#'   can be coerced to an svydesign object. When a data frame is coerced, the
#'   coercion assuming no clustering or design weighting.
#' @param ... One or more weight targets, or a single list of weight targets,
#'   in a form that can be coerced to class w8margin (see \code{\link{as.w8margin}}). 
#'   This includes named numeric vectors and matrices, and data frames in the format accepted by
#'   \code{rake}.
#' @param samplesize Either a number specifying the desired post-raking sample
#'   size, or a character string "from.data" or "from.targets" specifying how to
#'   calculate the desired sample size (see details).
#' @param match.levels.by A character string that specifies how to match levels in
#'   the target with the observed data, either "name" (the default) or "order"
#'   (see details).
#' @param match.vars.by A character  string that specifies how elements of
#'   targets are matched with variables in design, either "object.name" (the
#'   default) or "col.name" (see details).
#' @param rebase.tol Numeric between 0 and 1. If targets are rebased, and
#'   the rebased sample sizes differs from the original sample size by more than
#'   this percentage, generates a warning.
#' @param control Parameters passed to the \code{control} argument of \code{\link[survey]{rake}}, to control the details of convergence in weighting. 
#' @details rakesvy and rakew8 wrangles observed data and targets into compatible formats,
#'   before using \code{\link[survey]{rake}} to make underlying weighting calculations. The function matches weight targets to observed
#'   variables, cleans both targets and observed variables, and then checks the
#'   validity of weight targets (partially by calling
#'   \code{\link{w8margin_matched}}) before raking. It also allows a weight
#'   target of zero, and assigns an automatic weight of zero to cases on this target
#'   level.
#' @details Weight target levels can be matched with observed variable levels in
#'   two ways, specified via the \code{match.levels.by} parameter. "name" (the
#'   default) matches based on name, disregarding order (so a "male" level in
#'   the weight target will be matched with a "male" level in the observed
#'   data). "order" matches based on order, disregarding name (so the first
#'   level or row of the target will match with the first level of the observed
#'   factor variable).
#' @details Weight targets can also be matched to observed variables in two
#'   ways, specified via the \code{match.vars.by} parameter. The default,
#'   "object.name", indicated that the names of target objects
#'   should indicate variables in the design object. The alternative, "col.name"
#'   specifies that the non-"Freq" column name of each item in the list
#'   targets should indicate a matching variable in the design object;
#'   this will only work for weight targets in a \code{w8margin} or
#'   \code{data.frame} format.
#' @details The desired sample size (in other words, the desired sum of weights
#'   after raking)  is specified via the \code{samplesize} parameter. This can
#'   be a numeric value. Alternatively, "from.data" specifies that the observed
#'   sample size before weighting (taken from \code{sum(weights(design))} if
#'   applicable, or \code{nrow} if not); "from.targets" specifies that the total
#'   sample sizes in target objects should be followed, and should only be used
#'   if all targets specify the same sample size.
#' @return \code{rakesvy} returns an \code{svydesign} object with rake weights applied. Any changes
#'   made the variables in \code{design} in order to call \code{rake}, such as
#'   dropping empty factor levels, are temporary and \emph{not} returned in the
#'   output object. 
#' @return \code{rakew8} returns a vector of weights. This avoids creating
#'   duplicated \code{svydesign} objects, which can be useful when calculating multiple
#'   sets of weights for the same data.
