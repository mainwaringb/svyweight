\title{Effective Sample Size and Weighting Efficiency}
\usage{
eff_n(design)

weight_eff(design)
}
\arguments{
\item{design}{An \code{\link[survey]{svydesign}} object, presumably with
design or post-stratification weights.}
}
\description{
Computes Kish's effective sample size or weighting efficiency for a
  \code{\link[survey]{svydesign}} object.
}
\details{
Kish's effective sample size is a frequently-used, general metric to
  indicate how much uncertainty and error increase due to weighting. 
  Effective sample size is calculated as \code{sum(weights(design))^2 / sum(weights(design)^2)}. 
  Weighting efficiency is \code{eff_n(design) / sum(weights(design))}.

While weighting efficency and effective sample size are frequently use,
 they are less valid than the standard errors produced by
  \code{\link[survey]{svymean}} and related functions from the {survey}
  package. In particular, they ignore clustering and stratification in 
  sample designs, and covariance between weighting variables and outcome variables.
  As such, these metrics should be used with caution
